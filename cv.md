# FRONT-END DEVELOPER
*  I am distinguished by such qualities as optimism, the ability to work in a team, the willingness to take on new projects,
the desire for new knowledge, the ability to bring things to the end.
* My goal is to gain more confident skills and knowledge that will help me realize my dream - to become a confident developer in my knowledge.
